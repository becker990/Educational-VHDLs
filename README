	Educational VHDLs

	These are a collection of hardware devices from the 70's-80's computers,
they are made for use with Altera boards but without the use of megafunctions 
of any FPGA vendors, so they are implemented in hardware-like way.
	EDUCATIONAL POURPOSES i wrote them at class.

        Description of each:
template.vhd    -A template default VHDL with all the abstractions.
half_adder.vhd  -A half adder duh.
full_adder.vhd  -A full adder duh.
ripple.vhd      -Ripple-Carry adder, 4bits i think.
ctrl_ula.vhd    -Simple Logical-Arithmetical control unit.
ula.vhd         -LAU global unit.
dec_bcd7.vhd    -Type A decoder: 4bits -> 7segment.
dec3_8.vhd      -Type B decoder: 4bits -> 7segment.    
mux2_1.vhd      -1bit 2to1 simple multiplexer.
mux 4 bits.vhd  -1bit 4to1 multiplexer.
sr.vhd          -Right shifter.
sl.vhd          -Left shifter.
